Script for deleting all forked repos . I was tired of manually deleting my repos , by again nd again entering my password .
Just go to developer setting , use tokens(classic) , select all repos option , generate your token , paste in the script & delete all your forked repos.
Although , u can simply customise the script whether u wanted to see all forked repos  , or of a particular months or archived , public , private whatever depends up to u .

Just replace your personalised token in the script , and boom no hustle in deleting , i had around 60 + unneccessary repos :)
